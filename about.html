					<h1>ABOUT</h1>
					<img class="mainimg" src="img/about.png" />
					<p>Many a day goes on without people investigating the world around them. We recognize this kind of behaviour – we were once people who ignored the beauty of the world for the trivialities of our own lives.</p> 
					<p>It is easy to ignore the trees and natural structures that shape the space we live in. It is of little consequence to call the weather awful and hide away from it. </p>
					<p>These habits – the desire to live indoors and forget about nature – are bred into us. As children, we all loved sitting in the grass, and running around outside, and yet, as adults, we fear the outdoors and prefer the comfort of our own homes. </p>
					<p>We strongly believe that it is never too late to pick up your bags and take a walk around a space. The world is a large place. You'd be surprised about the things you'd never noticed and the places you've never been.</p>
					<hr />
					
					<h2>the two of us</h2>
					<p>We are a married couple living in Burnaby, who <i>love</i> adventure. After many years of being in the workforce and living straightforward lives, we have finally retired and have moved on to doing the things we love the most: exploring the outdoors.</p>

					<p>I have been working as a geologist for 40 years. Regardless of how age affects me, I plan on living and sharing my passion for mountaineering for many more years to come. I met my wife, Ruby, while we were in our later years of university, and we have been a team ever since. Our common interest in the outdoors has been the driving factor in marriage. We believe that where love is, journeys and adventures are sure to follow.</p>

					<p>After living the majority of my life as a high school teacher, I quit my job and moved on to being a children's storybook writer. I am in love with storytelling as an art, and have interest in sharing knowledge with other people. My husband, with his incredible insight on the history of natural formations, provides me with the motivation to journey the world and take part in many different experiences.</p>
